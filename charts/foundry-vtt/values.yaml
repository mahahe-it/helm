# felddy/foundryvtt-docker container extra customizations.
container:
  ## Set a different path to cache downloads of the Foundry distribution archive and speed up subsequent container startups. From v9.255.1 and v10.260.1 the /data/container_cache is created by default this is now enable by default to keep it consistent.
  cache: /data/container_cache

  ## `gid` the deamon will be run under. Default is `foundry`
  # gid: 421

  ## Set a path to a directory of shell scripts to be sourced after Foundry is installed but before it is started. The path should be in /data or another persistent mount point in the container. e.g.; /data/container_patches Patch files are sourced in lexicographic order. CONTAINER_PATCHES are processed after CONTAINER_PATCH_URLS.
  # patches: /data/patches

  ## Set to a space-delimited list of URLs to be sourced after Foundry is installed but before it is started. Patch URLs are sourced in the order specified. CONTAINER_PATCH_URLS are processed before CONTAINER_PATCHES. ⚠️ Only use patch URLs from trusted sources!
  # patchUrls:
  #   - https://www.path.example/z.sh
  #   - https://www.path.example/b.sh

  ## Normally new `options.json` and `admin.txt` files are generated by the container at each startup.  Setting this to `true` prevents the container from modifying these files when they exist.  If they do not exist, they will be created as normal. Default is false.
  preserveConfig: false

  ## Normally the ownership of the `/data` directory and its contents are changed to match that of the server at startup.  Setting this to a regular expression will exclude any matching paths and preserve their ownership.   _Note: This is a match on the whole path, not a search._  This is useful if you want mount a volume as read-only inside `/data`
  # preserveOwner:

  ## Container [TZ database name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List). Default is UTC
  timezone: UTC

  ## `uid` the daemon will be run under. Default is `foundry`
  # uid: 421

  ## Set to `true` to enable verbose logging for the container utility scripts. Default is false
  verbose: false

# Foundry VTT Custom configurations
foundryvtt:
  ###########################################
  ### All configurations details are provided here: https://foundryvtt.com/article/hosting/
  ### All supported environment variables can be found here: https://github.com/felddy/foundryvtt-docker/README.md

  ## Account username or email address for foundryvtt.com. Required for downloading an application distribution.

  username: ""
  ## Account password for foundryvtt.com. Required for downloading an application distribution.

  password: ""

  ## Existing secret containing either a license key or a username/password combination.
  ## Must contain either a username/password data pair or a licenseKey entry, together with an adminPassword data key
  existingLicenseType: "account"
  existingSecret: ""

  ## The license key to install. e.g.; AAAA-BBBB-CCCC-DDDD-EEEE-FFFF If left unset, a license key will be fetched when using account authentication. If multiple license keys are associated with an account, one will be chosen at random. Specific licenses can be selected by passing in an integer index. The first license key being 1.
  licenseKey: ""

  ## Admin password. Required
  adminPassword: ""

  ## A custom hostname to use in place of the host machine's public IP address when displaying the address of the game session. This allows for reverse proxies or DNS servers to modify the public address.
  hostname: "foundry.domain.com"

  ## The default application language and module which provides the core translation files. Default is "en.core"
  language: en.core

  ## Set to `true` to reduce network traffic by serving minified static JavaScript and CSS files.  Enabling this setting is recommended for most users, but module developers may wish to disable it. Default is `false`.
  minifyStaticFiles: true

  ## Inform the Foundry Server that the software is running behind a reverse proxy on some other port. This allows the invitation links created to the game to include the correct external port.
  # proxyPort: "80"

  ## Indicates whether the software is running behind a reverse proxy that uses SSL. This allows invitation links and A/V functionality to work as if the Foundry Server had SSL configured directly.
  proxySSL: true

  ## A string path which is appended to the base hostname to serve Foundry VTT content from a specific namespace. For example setting this to demo will result in data being served from http://x.x.x.x:30000/demo/.
  # routePrefix: "/demo"

  ## Credentials for generate the [awsConfig.json](https://foundryvtt.com/article/aws-s3/)
  s3:
    enabled: false

    # Set to the name of an existing secret in the same namespace as the release
    # The secret must contain one data entry named aws-credentials.json
    # with value equal to the [AWS config file](https://foundryvtt.com/article/aws-s3/)
    existingSecret: ""
    config:
      accessKey: ""
      secretKey: ""
      region: ""
      endpoint: ""

  ## An absolute or relative path that points towards an SSL key/cert file which is used jointly with the sslCert option to enable SSL and https connections. If both options are provided, the server will start using HTTPS automatically.
  # sslCert: null
  # sslKey: null

  ## An array of TURN configurations in JSON format. See: [Using a Custom Relay Server](https://foundryvtt.com/article/audio-video/custom). To disable the internal relay server comment the paramenter. It will be converted when stored in the secrets
  # turnConfigs:
  #   - url: "turn:example.com:3478"
  #     urls:
  #       - "turn:example.com:3478"
  #       - "turns:example.com:5349"
  #     username: "my username"
  #     credential: "my password"

  ## Sets the maximum UDP port used by the internal [TURN relay server](https://foundryvtt.com/article/audio-video/).  This value must be greater than `49152`.  _Note: To use the internal relay server its ports must be published.
  # turnMaxPort: 52300

  ## Allow Universal Plug and Play to automatically request port forwarding for the Foundry VTT port to your local network address. Default is true.
  upnp: false

  ## Version of Foundry VTT to install.
  version: 10.288

  ## The world startup at system start.
  world: ""
